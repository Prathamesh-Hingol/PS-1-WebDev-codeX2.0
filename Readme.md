# Web Development – PS1 (Beginner)

This repository contains my solution to the **PS1 (Beginner)** assignment – building a basic layout mimicking the [CSES (Code Submission Evaluation System)](https://cses.fi) homepage.

---

## 📜 Problem Statement

Build a responsive web layout inspired by the CSES homepage using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This task was aimed at practicing fundamentals like semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox/Grid, and responsive styling.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for page structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3** – for layout, styling, and responsiveness (Flexbox, Grid).

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

- 🎨 **CSES-style layout** – recreated the main sections of the CSES homepage (Problem Set, Blog, Contest Collection, etc.).
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – works across multiple screen sizes.
- 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** – a toggle button placed next to the “Login” link switches between dark and light themes dynamically.
